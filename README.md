# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver

There exist 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 unique combinations for solving a rubik’s cube!!!!.
This project aims to design, build, and successfully demonstrate an automated Rubik's Cube solver. By undertaking this project, participants will deepen their understanding of algorithms, robotics, and mechanical engineering. The project will involve creating a robust and precise mechanical system, selecting and integrating appropriate electronic components such as motors and sensors, and developing a software algorithm capable of solving the Rubik’s Cube. Through iterative testing and refinements, this project will enhance practical engineering skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork, culminating in a functional and efficient Rubik’s Cube-solving machine.
